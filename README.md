We are happy to share with you our game called SurvivAnt, which we developed for the Game Jam organized by GameDev.tv, whose contents we follow with 
pleasure with my teammates. 

Our game, shaped around the "Last Stand" theme given for Game Jam, is about the adventure of an ant whose colony was destroyed by two content producers
for the sake of viewing, to protect the last remaining queen chick. 

 I would like to thank the entire GameDev.tv team, especially Rick Davidson, for the content they provided and the enjoyable Game Jam they organized.
 I would also like to thank my teammates Emir Safa √ñzden, Sarven yontan and Emin √ñzer Eskimez, who devoted their time and effort for this project. üôè
